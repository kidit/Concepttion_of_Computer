1. Hard disk drives

    1. Positioning time

        1. move disk arm to desired cylinder (seek time)

        2. equals random - access time

    2. Time for desired sector to rotate under the disk head

        1. rotational latency
    
2. NAND Flash Controller Algorithms

    1. with no overwrite, pages end up with mix of valid and invalid data

    2. To track which logical blocks are valid

        1. controller maintains flash translation layer (FTL) table

    3. Also implements garbage collection to free invalid page space

    4. Allocates overprovisioning to provide working space for GC

        1. 전체 중 20%정도를 따로 분리하여 항상 쓸 수 있는 pages 확보

    5. Each cell has lifespan, so wear leveling needed to write equally to all cells


3. HDD Scheduling

    1. the operating system is responsible for using hardware efficiently for the disk drives

        1. it means that having a fast access time and dsk bandwidth

    2. Minimize seek time

    3. Seek time ~= seek distance

    4. Disk bandwidth is the total number of bytes transferred

        1. divided by the total time between the first request for service

        2. and the completion of the last transfer

4. NVM Scheduling

    1. No disk heads or rotational latency but still rom for optimization

    2. In RHEL 7 NOOP (no scheduling) is used but adjacent LBA requests are combined

        1. NVM best at random I/O, HDD at sequential

        2. throughput can be Similar

        3. Input / output operations per second (IOPS) much higher with NVM

            1. hundreds of thousands VS hundreds
        
        4. But write amplification can decrease the performance advantage

            1. one write, causing garbage collection and many read / writes
